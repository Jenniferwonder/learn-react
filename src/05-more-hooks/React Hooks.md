# React Hooks
## Reference
- [React Hooks 入门教程 - 阮一峰的网络日志](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2019/09/react-hooks.html)
## Hooks Concept
- Functions starting with `use` are called _Hooks_.
- React Hooks 的意思是，组件尽量写成纯函数，如果需要外部功能和副作用，就用钩子把外部代码"钩"进。React Hooks 就是那些钩子
## Rules
- You can only call Hooks at the *top* of your components (or other Hooks)
- If you want to use `useState` in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there

### Built-in Hooks
